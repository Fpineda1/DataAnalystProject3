# Data Analyst Project 3

Project 3 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program 

This project is an analysis of A/B test results looking at coversion rates for a treatment (new page) and control (old page).
I calculated the p-value of the conversion rates for both the control and the treatment to determine if there was a significant difference.
I also performed logistical regression to determine if the country the customer was located in had any effect on conversion rate.
